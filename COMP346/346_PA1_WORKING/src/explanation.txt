The server thread and the client thread end at different times.
Specifically, the server thread ends after the client thread, every time.

This has to do with how the client thread's last action is to receive the
transactions, which ends before the server processes the final transaction.
The client cannot receive an account which hasn't been processed. If the
server thread ended before the client thread, then there would be no
guarantee that the last accounts were processed at all.
